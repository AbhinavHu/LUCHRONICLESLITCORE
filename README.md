# LU Chronicles – Cursor Project for Lucknow University 🏛️

A modern web platform built to centralize and share campus updates, news articles, and faculty/student information for **Lucknow University**. This project aims to enhance digital communication across the LU community.

## 🎯 Project Goal

LU Chronicles is designed as a digital noticeboard and interactive portal where:

- Students can **read articles**, **view faculty info**, and **explore the team**
- Visitors can **donate** to support student initiatives
- Admins can **add, update, and manage** all content via a secure dashboard

## 🧠 How It Works

Think of the website like a digital library and admin room:

- 📰 **Articles Page**: Displays curated stories, announcements, and updates  
- 👥 **Team Page**: Showcases contributors and organizers  
- 🎓 **Faculty Page**: Lists department-wise faculty information  
- 💰 **Donate Page**: Accepts contributions via UPI/QR  
- 🔐 **Admin Panel**: A secure system where authorized admins manage all content (built into the same site)
